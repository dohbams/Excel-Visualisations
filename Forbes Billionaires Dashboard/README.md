Forbes has released its list of the world's wealthiest individuals and families every year since 1987. This list includes the prestigious 0.00003 percent club. There are 7.96 billion people on the planet, and just a few are billionaires. The 36th annual Forbes list of the world's billionaires comprised 2,668 billionaires with a combined net worth of $12.7 trillion, a decrease of 97 members from 2021. 

From my analysis, I discovered the following insights;

1. Most billionaires are self-made while others acquire their wealth by inheritance or a mix of both self-made and by inheritance.

2. At 744, United States has the highest number of billionaires followed by China (571) and India (159).﻿﻿ These three countries are home to 55% of the billionaires in the world. The ﻿﻿United States accounts for 37.75% of the total number of billionaires.﻿﻿ ﻿

3. The financial and Investments Industry produced the highest number of billionaires having a combined net worth of $1.74 T

4.  Having a net worth of $219 B, Elon Musk is the richest man alive. He is the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla; The Boring Company's founder; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. 

5.  An overwhelming proportion of billinaires are male. Most self-made billionaires are male. However, the average net worth of self-made female billionaires is 4% higher than their male counterparts.
